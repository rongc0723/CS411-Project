user story 2 (search for recipe)
As a logged-in user of this recipe platform, I want to be able to search for recipes based on a specific cuisine keyword so that I can easily find dishes 
that match my preferences and cooking style. This feature would save me time by narrowing down the search results to only those that match my desired 
cuisine, rather than having to scroll through endless recipe options. If everything goes smoothly, the user can simply type in a cuisine keyword such as 
"Spanish" or "Indian," and the app will return a list of recipes that are curated towards that cuisine. However, if something goes wrong, 
such as the app not being able to find any recipes related to the user's input, an error message will appear suggesting the user to try another word. 
If there is an issue with the database, the app will not generate the corresponding recipes for the user.
