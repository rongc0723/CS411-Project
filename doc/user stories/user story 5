user story 5 (navbar)
As a logged-in user, I would like to go back to the search page by clicking the search button on the top right corner to search for new
recipes. I would also want to have quick access to my favorite page by clicking the heart button right next to the search button. 
With these buttons, I can easily start a new search process or check my favorite recipes/music list.
