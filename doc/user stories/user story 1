user story 1 (login)
As a user, I would like to have the option to log in to this web application using my Gmail account so that I can easily access the platform 
without having to remember another username and password. This feature would also allow me to sign in to the platform quickly and securely, 
as I trust Gmail's security measures to safeguard my personal information. If everything goes well, users will be directed to a login page where 
they can enter their email address and password to log in through their Gmail account and create their profile. If something goes wrong, 
such as the user entering an invalid email address or an incorrect password, a pop-up box will appear stating "invalid email address" 
or "unable to login." This way, users cannot log in to their Gmail account from the web app.
