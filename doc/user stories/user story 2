user story 2 (search for cuisine)
“As a logged-in user, I want to search for different types of cuisine with its recipe.”

everything goes right:
Users will type in the style of cuisine they would like to make like “Spanish, Indian, Greek, etc.” And the app will list a couple of cuisines in the desired type with its recipe.

something goes wrong:
The app could not find the type of cuisine and will not provide recipes the users want.
