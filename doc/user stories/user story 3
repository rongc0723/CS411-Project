user story 3 (generate music list)
“As a logged-in user, I want to listen to some music while I'm cooking.”

everything goes right:
The app will generate a music list from Spotify that corresponds to the style of cuisine like songs in Spanish or by Spanish singers if the users are looking for Spanish cuisine.

something goes wrong:
The music list is not corresponding to the types of cuisine.
