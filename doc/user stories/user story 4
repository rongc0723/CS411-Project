user story 4 (favorite page)
As a logged-in user, I would like to be able to mark a recipe or playlist as a favorite so that I can easily access it later. Additionally, 
I would like to display my favorite recipes and playlists on my user profile for quick reference. When browsing recipes or playlists, I should be able 
to click a "Favorite" button to add the item to my favorites list. The item should then be saved to my user profile, allowing me to access it later 
by clicking on the "Favorites" tab on my user profile page. If everything goes well, I will be able to view a list of all my favorite recipes and playlists
in my favorites collection, with the option to remove any items that I no longer wish to keep. If something goes wrong, such as the failure to add items 
to my favorites when I click the button, the feature will not work properly. Overall, this feature will simplify the process of keeping track of the 
recipes and playlists I love, and will enhance my user experience by providing a personalized touch.
