react: We use react.js as our framework because it has packages and tools that make coding easier. And the component function helps to organize 
reusable components that can be applied to different pages. We would like to learn a new language when deciding which stack to use, and react.js 
became our final choice because it’s commonly used for web development, and there are plenty of resources to learn from. We are using Node.js as our 
backend because we are all familiar with javascript and Node.js allows us to easily fetch data from API calls. 
firebase: We are using firebase as our database because firebase handles user authentication and authorization for us without needing to write a 
lot of backend code. It’s easy to use and saves time when processing the user information.
